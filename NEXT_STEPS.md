- User feedback
- Performance metrics
Decision: Continue or rollback
```

#### Stage 2: Limited (25% of traffic)
```
Duration: 3-5 days
Monitor:
- All metrics stable
- User feedback positive
- No critical issues
Decision: Continue or adjust
```

#### Stage 3: Full Rollout (100% of traffic)
```
Duration: Ongoing
Monitor:
- Continued monitoring
- Feedback collection
- Plan next iteration
```

### Rollback Plan
```
If issues detected:
1. Immediate: Revert to previous version
2. Diagnose: Review logs and feedback
3. Fix: Address issues in development
4. Re-test: Validate fixes thoroughly
5. Re-deploy: Start staged rollout again

Property Details: {{2.formatted_text}}

COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH PROTOCOL:

üå™Ô∏è **SEARCH ALL STORM EVENTS WITHIN 15 MILES**
- Hail events of any size
- Wind events of any speed  
- Tornado events and ratings
- Ground damage reports
- All storm-related incidents
- Search radius: 15 miles maximum

üìä **TABLE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
Create a complete table with ALL storm events found, including:
- Event date and storm type
- Exact distance from property
- Hail size (if applicable)
- Wind speed (if applicable) 
- Tornado rating (if applicable)
- Damage descriptions (if applicable)
- Report source and location details
- Priority scoring based on proximity and severity

üéØ **PRIORITY SCORING SYSTEM:**
- Priority 10: Damage reports within 5 miles
- Priority 9: Hail 1"+ within 3 miles
- Priority 8: Wind 75+ mph within 2 miles
- Priority 7: Any tornado within 10 miles
- Priority 6: Hail 0.75"+ within 5 miles

- Priority 2: Moderate wind within 15 miles
- Priority 1: Other events within 15 miles

EXTRACTION PROTOCOL:
1. Extract property coordinates from address
2. Search ALL storm events within 15 miles
3. Create comprehensive table with complete information
4. Sort by distance from property (closest first)
5. Include priority scoring for each event
6. Provide analysis summary of storm activity patterns

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. **Use Current Date/Time**: Generate timestamp in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
2. **Calculate Risk Scores**: Use 0-1 scale based on actual storm physics
3. **Prioritize Damage-Causing Storms**: Only include storms that can damage buildings
4. **Include Storm Imagery**: Use URLs from storm imagery system
5. **Generate Realistic Recommendations**: Based on actual storm types and building vulnerability
6. **Professional Narrative**: Write clear, technical descriptions for each storm

**RISK SCORING GUIDELINES:**
- **Overall Risk Score**: 0.8+ = Multiple severe events within 2 miles, 0.6-0.8 = Moderate events, 0.4-0.6 = Minor events, <0.4 = Low risk
- **Hail Probability**: Based on hail size and proximity (2"+ hail within 2 miles = 0.8+)
- **Wind Probability**: Based on wind speed and proximity (75+ mph within 2 miles = 0.7+)
- **Severity Score**: Per storm based on size/speed and distance (closer + larger = higher score)

**RECOMMENDATION GUIDELINES:**
Generate 3-6 specific recommendations based on actual storm types found:
- Hail events: Roof inspection, soft metals, gutters, HVAC
- Wind events: Structural inspection, siding, windows, trees
- Multiple events: Comprehensive inspection, attic check, exterior survey

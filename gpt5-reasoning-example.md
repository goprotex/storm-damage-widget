## Key Benefits of GPT-5 Reasoning Analysis:

✅ **Physics-Based Assessment** - Connects actual storm forces with specific building vulnerabilities  
✅ **Cumulative Damage Analysis** - Considers how multiple events compound risk  
✅ **Construction Science** - Matches building code eras with storm intensities  
✅ **Material-Specific Predictions** - Different responses for brick vs vinyl, metal vs asphalt  
✅ **Actionable Recommendations** - Specific inspection priorities and damage scenarios  
✅ **Claims Intelligence** - Realistic damage cost estimates based on actual vulnerabilities

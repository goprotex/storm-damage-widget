PRIMARY RESEARCH TARGETS:

üè† **BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS**
- Construction year (building age)
- Roof type and materials (asphalt shingles, metal, tile, etc.)
- Siding materials (vinyl, wood, brick, stucco, etc.)
- Foundation type (slab, crawl space, basement)
- Building stories/height
- Square footage and lot size

üèóÔ∏è **CONSTRUCTION DETAILS**
- Building code era (determines wind resistance standards)
- Window types (single/double pane, impact resistant)
- Garage configuration (attached/detached)
- Pool or outbuildings present
- Recent renovations or additions

üìç **LOCATION FACTORS**
- Neighborhood characteristics
- Proximity to trees, water bodies, or hills
